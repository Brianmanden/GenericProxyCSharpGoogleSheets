# GenericProxyCSharpGoogleSheets

# This projects aims at making a single proxy to contact when using Google Sheets for storage in web projects / apps.
## The idea is to have a single entry endpoint with CRUD functionality that you as a programmer can use instead of having to go through the hazzle of setting up multiple Google Sheets with Google Apps Script.

# This is Work In Progress so feel free to test and comment and maybe even contribute some code :)
